# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Week 5 course material for CVEN 5999: Special Topics - Data Analytics for Development, focusing on data reshaping with tidyr and working with vectors in R.

## Week 5 Content

- **Vectors**: Understanding R's fundamental data structures
- **Data Reshaping**: Pivoting data between wide and long formats
- **tidyr**: Using pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() functions

## File Structure

- `live-05a-vectors.qmd`: Introduction to vectors in R
- `live-05b-tidyr-pivoting.qmd`: Data pivoting techniques
- `hw-05a-tidyr.qmd`: Homework on data reshaping
- `learning-05.qmd`: Learning reflection
- `data/`: MSW composition data in various formats (CSV, RDS)
- `figs/`: Generated visualization outputs
- `references.bib`: Bibliography file for citations

## Key R Packages

- `tidyr`: Data reshaping and tidying (pivot_longer, pivot_wider)
- `dplyr`: Data manipulation
- `ggplot2`: Visualization of reshaped data

## Data Focus

- **MSW Composition Data**: Waste composition by income levels
- **Wide vs Long Format**: Understanding data structure transformations
- **Waste Composition**: Detailed analysis of waste streams (Bellevue study)
- **Income-based Analysis**: Comparing waste patterns across economic groups

## Reshaping Techniques

- Converting wide data to long format with pivot_longer()
- Converting long data to wide format with pivot_wider()
- Working with multiple value columns
- Handling missing data during reshaping
- Creating tidy datasets for analysis and visualization

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understand R vector types and operations
- Master data reshaping with tidyr
- Work with real waste management datasets
- Create effective visualizations from reshaped data
- Understand tidy data principles
